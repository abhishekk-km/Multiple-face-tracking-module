# Multiple-face-tracking-module
 This repository demonstrates a python code to demonstrate face detection and face tracking using opencv and mediapipe libraries

The above code is an implementation of a real-time face detection and tracking system using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Python.
 The system captures video from the computer's webcamand then uses Mediapipe's face detection model to detect faces in the video. If a face is detected, the system draws a bounding box around the face and calculates the recognition score of the face. The system also calculates the FPS (frames per second) and displays it on the screen. The system tracks the face and updates the bounding box and recognition score in real-time.\



System requirements:
vscode
python3.12
Mediapipe library
OpenCV library


Setup and Usage Instructions:

1.Clone the repository from GitHub.
2.Unzip the code attachment and navigate to the project directory.
3.Follow the instructions provided in the README file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies.
4.Run the main script to start the real-time face tracking system.
